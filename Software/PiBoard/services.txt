This document describes the SHM format for each service request.
The first byte in the SHM block should contain the code for the service you
want to call, and it will contain the return value (if any) when control is
passed back to the CPU.
16 and 32 bit values are stored little-endian order.

0x00 - Read disk sector
Read a sector from the disk image into system memory.
Byte 1: Drive number (zero-based)
Bytes 2-3: Track number (zero-based)
Bytes 4-5: Sector number (zero-based)
Bytes 6-9: Memory address
Return value: 0 for success, 1 for failure

0x01 - Write disk sector
Write a sector from system memory to the disk image file.
Byte 1: Drive number (zero-based)
Bytes 2-3: Track number (zero-based)
Bytes 4-5: Sector number (zero-based)
Bytes 6-9: Memory address
Return value: 0 for success, 1 for failure

0x02 - Check disk
Check that the specified drive is ready
Byte 1: Drive number (zero based)
Return value: 0 for success, 1 for failure

0x03 - Open file
Open a file from the Pi's filesystem for future read/write operations.
Byte 1: File number (multiple files can be opened at the same time)
Bytes 2-5: Memory address where the null-terminated filename is located
Byte 6: File mode flags
    bit 0: in (Open for input)
    bit 1: out (Open for output - can be combined with input)
    bit 2: binary (Binary mode)
    bit 3: ate (Set inital position at the end of the file)
    bit 4: app (Append to the end of an existing file)
    bit 5: trunc (Replace the file if it already exists)
Return value: 0 for success, 1 for failure

0x04 - Close file
Close a file that was opened with the call above.
Byte 1: File number to close
Return value: none

0x05 - Read from file
Read from an open file into memory.
Byte 1: File number to read from
Bytes 2-3: Number of bytes to read
Bytes 4-7: Memory address
Return value (2 bytes): Number of bytes that were successfully read

0x06 - Write to file
Write from system memory to an open file.
Byte 1: File number to write to
Bytes 2-3: Number of bytes to write
Bytes 4-7: Memory address
Return value (2 bytes): Number of bytes that were successfully written

0x07 - Seek file pointer
Seek to the specified position in an open file.
Byte 1: File number to seek
Bytes 2-5: File position (4GB max).
Return value: 0 for success, 1 for failure

0x10 - Get time (binary)
0x11 - Get time (BCD)
0x12 - Get time (CP/M format)

0x20 - Set SHM address
Set the SHM base address to be used for future service calls
Bytes 2-5: SHM base address
Return value: none

0x21 - Set drive parameters
Set the disk parameters for the specified drive.
Byte 1: Drive number
Bytes 2-3: Sector size (bytes)
Bytes 4-5: Sectors per track
Return value: 0 for success, 1 for failure

0xFE - Debug print
Print a value to the monitor window.
Byte 1: Mode
    0: Null terminated string at the address in bytes 2-5
    1: Hex value of bytes 2-5
    2: Decimal value of bytes 2-5
    3: ASCII char at byte 2
Return value: none

0xFF - Break
Stop execution and return to the monitor
Return value: none
